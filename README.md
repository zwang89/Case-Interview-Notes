# Case-Interview-Notes
(this notes contains information from Case in Point and my own notes while doing case interview practice with Eugene)

### 1. Principles for Case Interview
#### 1) Listen to the Question.
#### 2) Take Notes.
#### 3) Summarize Question
* to show you listen;
* allow you to hear the questions in a second time;
* prevent from answering the wrong question;
* provide extra time to think

#### 4) Verify the Objectives
#### 5) Ask clarifying questions
* to get additional information that will help you identify and label question;
* to demonstrate to the interviewer that you are not shy about asking probing qeustions;
* to turn the interview into a conversation;

>In the beginning of the case, you have more latitude in your questioning. You should ask basic questions about the company, the industry, the competition, external market factors, and the product. The further you get into the case, the more your questions should switch from open-ended questions to closed-ended questions. You start to get into trouble when you ask broad, sweeping questions that are hard for the interviewer to answer. These kinds of questions give the impression that you’re trying to get the interviewer to answer the case for you.(from Case in Point 9th)

#### 6) Organize your answer
#### 7) Hold your thought before it's ready
#### 8) Manage your time

* anwers should be linear and straightforwd
* start from macro level
* stay focused on original question
* do not lose your track of the question, the objective, or the framework

#### 9) Working with numbers
* when doing calculations, explain what you are thinking and how you are going to do it.

#### 10) Be coachable
* Listen to the interviewer's feedback;
* Asking for help when you need

#### 11) Be creative and Brainstorm
#### 12) Exude Enthusiasm and a Positive Attitude
#### 13) Bring Clousre and Summarize

### 2 Type of Case Questions
#### 1) Market-sizing Questions
* logic assumption is the key.
> Ask interviewer:"I’m not that familiar with
this market, so if my assumptions are off, please correct me."

* Key numbers should be meorize:
> * U.S. population is 320 million
> * Life expectancy of an American is 80 years
> * Even distribution between the ages: so there is the same number of 2-year-olds as 72-year-olds. We know that this is not true, but in a case like this, it’s fine to assume, thus 4 million people per age group.
> * 80 million per generation
> * 100 million U.S. households
#### 2) Factor Questions
#### 3) Business Case Questions

### 3 Case Framework
* A framework is a structure that helps you organize your thoughts and analyze the case in a logical manner.

#### Two parts:
##### First five steps:
1. Summarize the Question: Make sure you get the correct numbers (repeate the number);
  **Trick:** change the number in to percentage.

 For example: interviewer: _the price jumped from $15 to $18._
You should say _"the price increase 20%"_

2. Verify the objectives.
 For example, intervieer:"One objective is to raise profit?"

 You should ask "Are there any other objectives I should know about?"
3. Ask clarifying Questions (only when you do not understand the questions)


4. Label the case and lay out your structure (60s-90s)

 MECE Principle: ** Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive.** Then turn your notes and strutures to the interviewres to show your thought process.

5.State your hypothsis

##### Core to the case
* Company and Market

##### Four Key cases scenarios
###### Profit and loss
* framework Economy * (Profit = Revenue - Cost ) * Market
> You always want to look at external factors first. You want to know whether this is a company problem or an industry-wide problem. But first take a moment and draw your notes.

(Note: In here, you need to plug in industry section)
##### Entering a new market
"Why does the company wants to enter this market?" Is the first and critical questions you want to ask to your interviewer!

1. Then, start with questions about the company
2. Determin the state of current and future market
3. Investiage the market to determin whether entry makes good business sense.
4. If decided to enter, what is the best strategies to enter? ** from-scratch; aquire; joint venture alliance; and outsourcing.**

##### Pricing **（company S is coming out with a new product. How much should thye price it?**
1. what is the objective? - profit, market share, or brand positioning? How big it is? What products does it have?
2. Investigate the products: competitive analysis; cost-based pricing, and price-based costing.
3. Think about the product as a service not only a product like only one.
##### Growth and increasing sales
1. Investigate the industry
2. Investigate the company
